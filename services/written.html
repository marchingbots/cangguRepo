    <h5>
            Article 932. A holographic last will shall be entirely written by hand of the testator and shall be signed by 
            him. The testator shall leave the will with the notary. The notary, in the presence of two witnesses, shall 
            immediately  draw  up  a  deed  of  safekeeping,  signed  by  the  testator  and  the  witnesses,  either  at  the 
            bottom of the last will, if that has been made available to him, or separately, if the document was offered 
            to  him  sealed;  in  the  latter-mentioned  case,  the  testator,  in  the  presence  of  the  notary  and  the 
            witnesses, shall note on the cover and confirm with his signature that such sealed envelope contains his 
            last will. In the event that the testator, due to an impediment, which has arisen following the execution of 
            the last will or the cover, cannot sign the cover or the deed of safekeeping, or both of them, the notary, 
            shall make note thereof as well as of the cause of the impediment. 
            (Ov.75;Bw.633,937,943v.,953;Rv.656v.; Civ.970)  <br><br>

            <span class="text-success">NOTES: entirely written by hand; signed by testator; testator leaves will with notary; notary draws up DEED OF SAFEKEEPING signed by testator and witness; </span><br><hr><br>

            Article 933. Such holographic last will, pursuant to the previous article, kept by the notary, shall have the 
            same validity as a last will made by official deed, and shall be deemed to have been made on the same 
            date  as  that  of  the  deed  of  safekeeping,  without  having  regard  to  the  noted  date  on  the  last  will. 
            (Bw.231,932,938) (Supplemented by S.93-232) The holographic last will kept by the notary as a deed, 
            shall, unless otherwise stipulated, be presumed to be entirely written and signed by the testator's hand. <br><br>

            Article 934. The testator may, at all times, reclaim his holographic testament, provided that he accounts 
            for  the  reclaim  to  the  notary  in  an  authentic  deed.  The  reclaim  of  the  holographic  testament  shall  be 
            regarded as revocation. (Bw.992) <br><br>

            Article  935.  By  virtue  of  a  single  private  fully  written  document,  dated  and  signed  by  the  testator, 
            arrangements  may,  without  any  further  formalities,  be  made  following  his  *262  demise,  provided  that 
            they  shall  be  only  and  exclusively  for  the  appointment  of  executors,  with  respect  to  ordering  funeral 
            arrangements, legacies of clothing, personal belongings, personal ornaments and specific furniture. The 
            revocation of such document can take place privately in the same manner . 
            (Ov.75;Bw.515,936,945,951v.,992,1005;Rv.656;Civ.970)  <br><br>

            <span class="text-success">NOTES: separate document for arrangements including: executors, funeral arrangements, legacies of clothing, belongings, ornaments, furniture. Can be revoked privately. </span><br><hr><br>


            Article  936.  If  such  document,  as  mentioned  in  the  previous  article,  is  found  after  the  demise  of  the 
            testator, then this document shall be submitted to the orphans' chamber in the jurisdiction in which the 
            inheritance  is  available;  the  orphans'  chamber,  shall  open  the  document  if  it  is  sealed,  and  shall  in  all 
            circumstances,  prepare  minutes  of  the  submission  of  the  document  which  shall  include  details  of  the 
            condition  that  this  is  in;  finally,  the  board  shall  submit  the  document  to  a  notary,  to  be  kept  with  the 
            minutes. (Ov.41;Bw.23,937,942;Rv.656;Civ.1007) <br><br>

            Article  937.  A  holographic  will,  which  has  been  submitted  to  the  notary  in  a  sealed  envelope,  shall, 
            following  the  death  of  the  testator,  be  submitted  to  the  orphans'  chamber,  which  shall  then  act  in 
            accordance with the provisions of article 942 in relation to sealed last wills.
