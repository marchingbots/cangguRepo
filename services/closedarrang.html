            Article  940.  If  the  testator  intends  to  make  a  private  or  confidential  testament,  he  is  required  to  put  his 
            signature beside each of his stipulations, either those that he has personally written, or those that were 
            written by somebody else; the paper containing his stipulations, or the paper which serves as a cover, if 
            a cover is used, shall be closed *263 and sealed. <br><br>
            
            The testator shall also submit such document closed 
            and  sealed  to  the  notary,  in  the  presence  of  four  witnesses,  or  he  shall,  in  their  presence  have  the document closed and sealed, and shall declare that the aforementioned document contains his last will, 
            and that such last will, was either personally written and signed by him or written by somebody else but 
            signed by him. <br><br>
            
            The notary shall draw up a deed of clarification in respect thereof, which shall be written 
            on  that  paper,  or  on  the  paper  which  serves  as  a  cover;  this  deed  shall  be  signed  by  the  testator,  the 
            notary,  and  the  witnesses,  and  in  the  event  that  the  testator,  due  to  some  impediment  which  arose 
            following  the  signing  of  the  last  will,  is  unable  to  execute  the  deed  of  clarification,  then  a  note  shall  be 
            made of the cause of the impediment. <br><br>
            
            All formalities that have been carried out in the presence of the 
            notary  and  the  witnesses  must  be  complied  with,  without  executing  another  deed  in  the  interim.  The 
            private  or  confidential  last  will  shall  be  kept  with  the  minutes  of  the  notary,  who  has  received  such 
            document. (Bw.942v., 953;Rv.657;Civ.976) <br><br>
