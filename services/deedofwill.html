            Article 939. The notary, shall write or shall arrange to have the will of the testator written in clear terms 
            as  conveyed  by  the  testator.  If  the  witnesses  were  not  present  at  the  time  that  the  information  was 
            provided  and  the  draft  has  been  prepared  by  the  notary,  the  testator,  shall,  prior  to  the  reading  of  the 
            will,  submit  the  information  again  in  the  presence  of  witnesses.  Thereafter,  the  notary  shall,  in  the 
            presence of witnesses, read the will, and ask the testator whether the document that has been read by 
            him,  contains  his  last  will.  If  the  instructions  as  to  the  terms  of  the  last  will  have  been  submitted  in  the 
            presence of the witnesses, and if the last will is immediately put into writing, then the reading of the will 
            and  question  to  the  testator  shall  take  place  simultaneously  in  the  presence  of  witnesses.  The  deed, 
            shall, following this, be signed by the testator, the notary and the witnesses. If the testator declares that 
            he is unable to sign, or that he is impeded, then the statement and the cause of the impediment shall be 
            mentioned in the deed. The compliance with all these formalities shall be expressly stated in the deed of 
            the last will. (Bw.944,953;Civ.972v.) <br><br>

            Article  940.  If  the  testator  intends  to  make  a  private  or  confidential  testament,  he  is  required  to  put  his 
            signature beside each of his stipulations, either those that he has personally written, or those that were 
            written by somebody else; the paper containing his stipulations, or the paper which serves as a cover, if 
            a cover is used, shall be closed *263 and sealed. The testator shall also submit such document closed 
            and  sealed  to  the  notary,  in  the  presence  of  four  witnesses,  or  he  shall,  in  their  presence  have  the document closed and sealed, and shall declare that the aforementioned document contains his last will, 
            and that such last will, was either personally written and signed by him or written by somebody else but

            notary,  and  the  witnesses,  and  in  the  event  that  the  testator,  due  to  some  impediment  which  arose 
            following  the  signing  of  the  last  will,  is  unable  to  execute  the  deed  of  clarification,  then  a  note  shall  be 
            made of the cause of the impediment. All formalities that have been carried out in the presence of the 
            notary  and  the  witnesses  must  be  complied  with,  without  executing  another  deed  in  the  interim.  The 
            private  or  confidential  last  will  shall  be  kept  with  the  minutes  of  the  notary,  who  has  received  such 
            document. (Bw.942v., 953;Rv.657;Civ.976)

            notary shall draft the deed of superscription stating therein that the testator has written such statement 
            in the presence of the notary and the witnesses; that which has been stipulated in the aforementioned

            therein  of  the  condition  that  it  is  in;  it  shall,  thereafter  be  returned  to  the  notary  who  has  filed  such 
            document. (Ov.42;Bw.23,936v.,940;Rv.658;Civ.1007;Not.37;Weesk.62) 
            Article 943. The notary, who has kept a last will of any description with his minutes, shall, following the 
            demise of the testator, notify the relevant parties thereof. (Ov.41;Bw.472,932,938,940,992;S.20-305) 
            Article  944.  (Amended  by  S.32-42)  Witnesses  present  at  the  time  that  last  wills  are  made,  shall  be  of 
            age, and shall be resident in Indonesia. They shall understand the language in *264 which the last will 
            was drafted, or the language of the deed of superscription or deed of safekeeping. (Amended by S.17-

            the notary before whom the last will was drawn up shall be permitted to be witnesses of a last will, made 
            in the form of an official deed.
